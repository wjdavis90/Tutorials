Here we are going to walk through building an alignment using this [sequence data](https://github.com/wjdavis90/Tutorials/blob/main/Phylogenetics/data/Albugo_cox2.fasta) that were obtained from GanBank. I tytpically use [mafft](https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/server/), either the online version or the commandline version, to build aligments. For this tutorial, we are going to use the [online version of mafft](https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/server/) because it is user friendly and fast. Also, it does not require installing any new software!

### Step 1

Open Albugo_cox2.fasta in a sutiable text editor (e.g., [Notepadd++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) or [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/). Copy the sequences, go to [mafft's website](https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/server/), and paste them into box as shown in the screenshot below.
